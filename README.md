# AWS-TextToSpeech-Project
A fully serverless web application that converts user-submitted text to speech using Amazon Polly. Built with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SNS, S3, and Polly, the app lets users input text, choose a voice, and receive an audio playback of their input. Includes a clean frontend and backend architecture for learning and demonstration purposes.
