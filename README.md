# AWS-TextToSpeech-Project

This project demonstrates a serverless web application that converts user-submitted text into speech using various AWS services. Users can select a voice, enter text, and receive an audio file generated by **Amazon Polly**. The backend is powered by **AWS Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **SNS**, **S3**, and **Polly**, while the frontend is a simple static website.
